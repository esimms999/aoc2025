This website showcases my solutions, thought processes, and the creative ways I leverage R’s data manipulation and visualization capabilities to crack the daily coding conundrums. Each day, I’ll share my code, explanations, and insights, offering a glimpse into how R can be used to solve complex problems.\nThe Advent of Code is an annual event that brings together programmers worldwide to solve bite-sized, festive coding challenges throughout December. My goal is to complete as many puzzles as I can while showcasing R’s versatility, from tidyverse workflows to custom algorithms.\nLet’s celebrate the joy of coding this holiday season!"
