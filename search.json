    "text": "Welcome to My Advent of Code 2025 Journey\nJoin me as I tackle the exciting challenges of Advent of Code 2025, using the power of the R programming language to solve each puzzle. This website showcases my solutions, thought processes, and the creative ways I leverage R’s data manipulation and visualization capabilities to crack the daily coding conundrums. Each day, I’ll share my code, explanations, and insights, offering a glimpse into how R can be used to solve complex problems.\nThe Advent of Code is an annual event that brings together programmers worldwide to solve bite-sized, festive coding challenges throughout December. My goal is to complete as many puzzles as I can while showcasing R’s versatility, from tidyverse workflows to custom algorithms.\nLet’s celebrate the joy of coding this holiday season!\nThis is a Quarto website.\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites.\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"
